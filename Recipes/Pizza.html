    <p>Everyone should know what a pizza is if you don't then i have no hope for you, this is a recipe of a traditional italian pizza so let's just get straight into it.</p>

    <h1 class="center color">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams of Flour</li>
        <li>300 ml warm water</li>
        <li>7 g instant yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Semolina flour for dusting (or all purpose flour)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="center color">Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the yeast to warm water and let it stand for a few minutes for bubbles or foam to appear</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour yeasty water into the flour bowl slowly, mixing with a spoon at the same time. Once all the water has been added, add olive oil and mix with a spoon to combine</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer the dough to a clean table or kitchen bench that’s been dusted with flour. Knead with your hands for about 10 minutes until the dough is nice and smooth. If it’s too wet or sticky, add flour as needed (you can also use a stand mixer with a dough attachment to knead the dough)</p></li>
        <li><p>Roll into a ball, tucking under the sides and allow to rest covered with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap for 30 -60 mintues</p></li>
        <li><p>The dough would have doubled in size. Divide into 3 even balls then add a touch of olive oil to the top of the balls and let them rest covered with cling wrap or a damp cloth for a minimum of 2 hours. The longer the dough is left to rest, the better and softer the pizza base will be. I usually let it rest for 2 - 6 hours but it can also be left overnight <em>(note if resting overnight, make sure to wrap the tray well with cling wrap and place in the fridge).</em> </p></li>
        <li><p>Once rested, preheat the oven to its highest setting (mine reaches 250°C/475°F) for 30 minutes with your pizza stone or oven tray inside</p></li>
        <li><p>To make the pizza shape, dust your bench with semolina flour and using your hands gently stretch into a pizza shape</p></li>
        <li><p>Add your tomato sauce and your favourite toppings, all except the mozzarella cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and brush some onto the crust too.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gently move the pizza base to your heated pizza pan or oven tray.Cook in the oven on the lowest level for approximately 4-5 minutes</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from oven, add mozzarella cheese and place back in the oven for 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from oven, tear some fresh basil leaves and enjoy!</p></li>
