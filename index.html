    <p class="text">This is a list of dishes that i love from the top of my head and if someone asked me what i would want to eat i would probably choose these 3, 2 of them are Italian and one is Egyptian (<em>My country of origin</em>), so yeah you will have to choose them aswell ;> (<em>remember this list is completely subjective you can love whatever food/dish you like. <strong>OR CAN YOU</strong> *dramatic music supposed to kick in*</em>).</p>
    <p class="text margin">And since you came here that means you can't cook or you don't know how to make these dishes, And since i also don't know how to cook i'll help you by giving you the recipes from actual chefs like this one <em>i don't even know if he's a cheff</em>.</p>
