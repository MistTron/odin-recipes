    <h1>A chicken piccata recipe:</h1>
    <img src="../Images/chicken piccata.jpg" alt="An image of the recipe we are making">

    <p>This is an italian dish <em>i think</em> that i personally love it consists of pasta with some chicken breast and some sauce to go on it simple but great</p>

    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Chicken – You’ll need two pounds of chicken breasts, butterflied and sliced in half. </p></li>
        <li><p>Flour – Just a light coating of flour is all you need.</p></li>
        <li><p>Olive Oil plus butter – Use olive oil to sauté the chicken and unsalted butter for the sauce.</p></li>
        <li><p>Garlic – Just a few cloves, minced.</p></li>
        <li><p>Lemons – Two freshly squeezed lemons are needed for the sauce plus a little bit of zest.</p></li>
        <li><p>Capers – The key ingredient. You only need a couple tablespoons of this flavor booster. These are salty, so you may want to rinse them before using them (although I don’t always).</p></li>
        <li><p>Pasta – Angel hair pasta was used here, but any pasta you prefer works too. You could also serve this chicken over roasted veggies of your choice.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps to make:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Prep chicken. Butterfly the chicken breasts, and then slice in half. You should have four portions of chicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste, on both sides. Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, shaking off excess, and then set on a plate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sauté chicken. Using a large cast iron skillet, heat two tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. Cook two pieces of chicken at a time, cooking until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked completely. They should read 165 degrees on a digital thermometer. Set cooked chicken on a clean plate, and then repeat with remaining two portions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make sauce. When chicken is done, use the same pan to make the sauce. Keep drippings and add the butter over medium heat. (Be sure the skillet isn’t too hot.) When butter is melted, add garlic and stir for about a minute. Then add the lemon juice, lemon zest, chicken broth, and capers. Add a lid to the pan, and simmer the sauce until it reduces to half, approximately 7-8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Prepare pasta. Meanwhile, cook pasta to al dente, or according to packaged directions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve. To serve, add pasta to individual bowls. Then add a piece of sautéed chicken, and top with some of the warm lemon butter sauce with capers. Enjoy!</p></li>
    </ol>
